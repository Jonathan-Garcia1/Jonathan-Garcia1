## Education

- Codeup Data Science Nov 2023
  - Fully-immersive, project-based 20-week in-person career accelerator that provided me with 670+ hours of expert instruction in applied data science. Developed expertise across the full pipeline (planning, acquisition, preparation, exploration, modeling, storytelling), and comfortable working with real-world, messy data to deliver actionable insights to diverse stakeholders.

## Projects

- [New York Health Inspection Prediction](https://github.com/Somerville-2023/New-York-health-Inspection-Prediction/blob/main/final_notebook.ipynb)
  -  combined New York City's health inspection data with customer reviews from Google Maps to predict the outcomes of restaurant inspections. The team developed a tool to automatically collect and analyze customer feedback, aligning it with the corresponding health inspection periods. This approach included sentiment analysis of the reviews, providing a more nuanced view of each restaurant's performance. As a result, the project created a predictive model that offered a comprehensive understanding of health inspection outcomes, integrating both quantitative data and qualitative customer experiences.
